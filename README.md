# Microbit-AutoCar
a simple car kit for the bbc microbit

# Build the car yourself
to make the car yourself you need to have atleast one instance of the [hummingbird kit](https://store.birdbraintechnologies.com/products/hummingbird-bit-base-kit) for the microbit. for the car itself you need:
* two hummingbird motors
* one hummingbird battery
* two distance sensors
* and two multi-colored leds

assemble them in a way that is close enough to [the car shown here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-bEmCUCT4hbaji_sqFeeqL5s5iHQLJt-?usp=sharing) (this one i built)
But once you have it down close enough and with the hardware you want for it, just
download the hex file release and put it on both microbits.

Optionally for the controller you can have another hummingbird bit but only install the two LEDs and battery however it's much cheaper, if you want, to just have the microbit plain.
