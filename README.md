# Microbit-AutoCar
a simple car kit for the bbc microbit

# Build the car yourself
to make the car yourself you need to have atleast one instance of the [hummingbird kit](https://store.birdbraintechnologies.com/products/hummingbird-bit-base-kit) for the microbit. for the car itself you need:
* two hummingbird motors
* one hummingbird battery
* two distance sensors
* and two multi-colored leds

assemble them in a way that is close enough to [the car shown here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-bEmCUCT4hbaji_sqFeeqL5s5iHQLJt-?usp=sharing) (this one i built)
